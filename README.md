## FAQ

#### "Why no communication on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rev_Populi)?!?"

The Team has clearly stated that from now on the only communication on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rev_Populi) will be major announcements related to the project. If there is no tweet - there's nothing major to say.
Communication is made through [GitHub](https://github.com/Revolution-Populi) commits which are posted on a daily basis.

#### Wen mainnet?
No one besides the Team knows, all you can do is speculate. Follow the [GitHub](https://github.com/Revolution-Populi) for daily updates and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rev_Populi) for any major announcements.

#### What is [BitShares (BTS)](https://www.abra.com/cryptocurrency/bitshares/)?

RVP is a fork of well established blockchain software named [Bitshares (BTS)](https://www.abra.com/cryptocurrency/bitshares/).

#### Why ETH Token?

When mainnet arrives, RVP will be tradeable on its own platform. Until then, RVP will be traded as an ERC-20 Token on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x17ef75aa22dd5f6c2763b8304ab24f40ee54d48a&outputCurrency=ETH). This was done mainly to allow restricted countries to participate.

#### What is [Axioma](https://www.axiomadev.com/)?

[Axioma](https://www.axiomadev.com/) is a blockchain development company based in Latvia that is currently developing RVP.

#### Is "X" partnering with RVP?

Most of the unverified information related to any partnerships is based on random speculation. If something was not confirmed by the Team itself or any other party - then probably it's fake.


## THE RVP BLOCKCHAIN

- Layer-1 network

A layer-1 network is another name for a base blockchain. BNB Smart Chain (BNB), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Solana are all layer-1 protocols. Now, RevPop (RVP) will be one of them.

- 100,000 transactions per second

With 100K transactions per second, it is one of the fastest blockchains on the market.

- rdPOS (random delegated Proof Of Stake)

RVP designed a rdPOS system based on an iteration of delegated proof of stake called ‚Äúrandom‚Äù delegated proof of stake or ‚ÄúrdPOS‚Äù where 21 of the top 63 witnesses are randomly selected.

## Applications

The RVP blockchain will be an open ecosystem for apps, from social to games to financial and compatible with open source social net components for multiple social nets to bloom.

Here are some examples.

 ## Decentralized clearing house

 #### First off, what is a clearing house?

Clearinghouses are designed to sit in between trades in order to guarantee payment in the event either counter party defaults, ensure trading desks are able to handle orders. They guarantee the enforcement of a trade and help create liquidity.

#### So why is a clearinghouse needed? 

Crypto can be considered an emerging market in economic terms. Emerging markets of any kind tend to need a clearing house, an entity that gives participants confidence that trades will be completed. [Forbes on the issue](https://google.co.uk/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/03/15/jpmorgan-is-eyeing-bitcoin-and-crypto-clearinghouse-options-amid-huge-price-rally/amp/)

By vouching for all participants, with no bias toward any party a clearing house injects confidence, which reduces risk. Institutions have not been adopting crypto, only very few have. and the reason for that is the trades are not guaranteed. A clearing house is what‚Äôs missing.

‚ÄúIn the crypto-currency market today, the biggest thing missing is a clearing house of some sort," said a senior executive at JP Morgan Chase who is familiar with RVP's efforts, in an interview with [ZDnet](https://google.co.uk/amp/s/www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/revpops-crypto-clearing-house-could-potentially-super-charge-the-volume-of-crypto-trading/).

The biggest institutions will be able to enter, therefore super charging the volume of crypto trading. RVP will be at the centre of institutional adoption and the addition of billions of dollars to the market.  It will also have yield generating settlements.

And that is not all, this is where it gets real interesting. Revolution Populi have added JPMorgan managing director Gary Chan to its team as ‚Äúclearing house advisor.‚Äù If that isn‚Äôt a telling sign of what‚Äôs to come, i‚Äôm not sure what is.

Often in life it‚Äôs not about what you know, but who you know. RVP have the best connections to make this project a huge success, Clearinghouses have market caps in the billions. This team with its connections will see it done.

## Decentralized social media

Moving onto the social media aspect of this project. There's one thing everyone can agree on: The model is broken. You can't have a neutral public square and have one guy determine what can be said. And not only that, to then have our data packaged and sold. RVP fixes this.
[The ‚ÄòBillion-Dollar‚Äô Plan To Kick Facebook While It‚Äôs Down](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/01/31/the-billion-dollar-plan-to-kick-facebook-while-its-down/?sh=2e1317084203)

Revolution Populi is one stop closer to planting a flag for social networks that don't control (or sell) user data. Data is a natural resource, and your data should only be owned by you.

>We propose a new social net, where members own their own data andmake money selling it ‚Äì where people describe their lives online, just asthey do today, but advertisers pay them, not Facebook. - from ["A thesis on digital freedom"](https://revolutionpopuli.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Revolution-Populi-1.pdf) by RVP

A layer-1 decentralized database with user controls, has tapped Matic Network as a layer-2 solution, allowing developers on the RevPop chain to build their own decentralized applications.

One of the RVP founders - David Gelernter, a famed Yale computer science professor, invented in the mid-1990s a program called Lifestreams. It would come to be regarded as one of the very first social network programs.


## Decentralized exchanges

DEX's will be necessary for the prosperity of crypto, and with a decentralized blockchain that allows up to 100,000 transactions per second, RVP will be the perfect candidate. 

No more FTX-like situations.
 
## Tokenomics

Fair Token Distribution. No private sales.

- 2b Total Token Supply
- 1.2b Circulating Supply

Token Supply is fixed. No more will be minted. This means that your RVP tokens are scarce by nature.

#### Public Dutch Auction

RevPop held a public auction for 60% of the total supply of tokens. 20% will be locked for a DAO foundation, 10% will be on lockdown for the team until 18 months after the mainnet. 10% will be for admin and operations.
